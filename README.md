- ###  Pre-requisite:
  - Pygame module: pygame is a free and open-source cross-platform library for the development of multimedia applications like video games using Python. It uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer library and several other popular libraries to abstract the most common functions, making writing these programs a more intuitive task.

  - Run the application locally by downloading using code: $ git clone https://github.com/rutuja1302/SnakeGame
  - You can set difficulty level as per your choice
  - Snake food is located at random places on the window screen, which the sanke has to locate and eat. With each food the snake eats, you get a point!
  - You have to help the snake to locate the food by giving directions using the following keys: UP [to direct the snake in up direction], DOWN [to direct the snake in downwards direction], similarly RIGHT and LEFT keys [for directing the snake in right nd left directions respectively].
  - With each increasing point, the body of the snake increases, If you go out of bounds i.e,touch the window screen or touch the snake body part itself the snake dies and another window pops up with your final score!
